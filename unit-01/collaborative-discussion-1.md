Advances have strongly influenced the growth of agent-based systems (ABS) in artificial intelligence, faster processing power, and the increasing complexity of the environments in which organisations operate. As Wooldridge (2009) explains, agents are autonomous entities that can perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and act to achieve specific objectives. This ability to function without continuous central control makes them suitable for dynamic and unpredictable scenarios.  

One reason for their rise is that many modern organisational problems, especially in finance, involve large-scale, decentralised data and the need for rapid responses. Russell and Norvig (2021) highlight that agent-based approaches allow systems to make local decisions while contributing to a global goal, which is essential when delays could lead to risks.  

A good example is the use of credit scoring agents in the financial sector. These agents can analyse multiple data sources in real time, such as spending behaviour or transaction patterns. They can adapt scoring models based on new information and even adjust lending decisions instantly. This automated scoring approach reduces human analysis and speeds up approvals, optimising loan processes and helping institutions manage risk more effectively.  

The organisational benefits go beyond efficiency. As Foit (2022) shows in a different domain, self-organising agents can coordinate, detect issues early, and optimise processes. Applied to finance, these same properties help credit systems become more accurate, scalable, and resilient in volatile markets. This combination of autonomy, adaptability, and distributed decision-making explains why agent-based systems are now considered a strategic asset in multiple industries.
