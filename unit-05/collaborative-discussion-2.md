Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) like KQML and FIPA-ACL were created to let agents talk to each other in a structured way. Instead of just calling a method directly (like in Python or Java), ACLs use performatives such as inform, ask or request, which come from speech act theory (Searle, 1969). The advantage here is that agents don’t need to know each other’s inner workings – as long as they share a common ontology, they can exchange information and coordinate actions (Finin et al., 1994). This makes them particularly useful in distributed or heterogeneous environments.
Of course, there are drawbacks too. Designing and maintaining ontologies is not simple, and if agents interpret terms differently, communication can break down (Payne and Tamma, 2014). ACLs also tend to be less efficient compared to method invocation, which is faster and more straightforward in closed systems. That said, method invocation ties everything together quite tightly, which makes it less flexible in dynamic environments.
Recently new protocols have been becoming a new standard to agents communication, specially for Generative AI tools, between the I highlight the Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced in 2024. MCP now has been widely used by companies like OpenAI and Microsoft. Unlike KQML, which is more about agent-to-agent communication, MCP focuses on agent-to-tool interoperability, giving agents a universal interface to fetch context or trigger services.
Compared with method invocation in languages like Python or Java, ACLs and newer protocols such as MCP work at a higher level of abstraction. A direct method call is efficient, but less flexible. ACLs, on the other hand, are designed for open and heterogeneous settings, where autonomy and negotiation matter more. MCP sits somewhere else in the picture: it doesn’t replace method calls but provides a standard bridge between agents and tools, which is increasingly important as modern AI systems depend on external data and services.
