## Summary Post

In my initial post I discussed how agent-based systems (ABS) have become more relevant as organisations face greater complexity and the need for autonomy in decision-making. Wooldridge (2009) describes agents as entities that can perceive their environment, reason, and act toward goals. This view explains why ABS fit so well in areas where human supervision is not always possible. The example of credit scoring in the financial sector, shows how autonomy and adaptability support both efficiency and risk management. Agents can process large amounts of data in real time, adapt scoring models when new information becomes available, and provide quicker and more accurate lending decisions.

The feedback I received encouraged me to extend the discussion beyond finance and to look at supply chain management. This is a good point, since ABS are not limited to a single industry. In logistics, for example, agents can track inventory, anticipate demand, and adjust deliveries without central control. Chen (2024) shows how Amazon applies agent-based models to optimise warehouses, which reduces costs while keeping products available when and where they are needed. These examples reinforce that ABS can bring resilience and flexibility to very different sectors.

Russell and Norvig (2021) highlight the core properties of intelligent agents: autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and social ability. These traits explain why ABS can work across diverse domains. Some agents are reactive, providing immediate responses to changes, while others are deliberative, focusing on planning. Hybrid models combine both approaches, making them adaptable to different organisational needs.

Reflecting on feedbacks, I see ABS not only as a specialised tools but it is a wider paradigm. They provide a way to manage complexity through decentralised decision-making and collaboration, which is why they are becoming central to finance, logistics, and many other industries.
