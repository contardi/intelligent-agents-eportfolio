Deep learning supports both non-generative and generative technologies. Beyond text- or image-generation systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) drive non-generative applications including medical imaging and industrial monitoring. These models can identify tumours or detect faults on production lines with human-level accuracy (Esteva et al., 2017). Other architectures, such as recurrent and transformer models, enable predictive maintenance and speech recognition, where precision rather than creativity is central (Russell and Norvig, 2021).

However, both types raise ethical concerns. Generative models may reproduce bias or generate persuasive misinformation, while non-generative ones can embed discrimination if training data under-represent specific groups (Nasim, Ali and Kulsoom, 2022). Large-scale models also consume vast energy resources, posing sustainability issues (Strubell, Ganesh and McCallum, 2019). Furthermore, deepfake technologies have blurred the line between authentic and synthetic media, threatening public trust (Verdoliva, 2020).

Ethical deep-learning practice therefore requires transparency in datasets, interpretability of model outputs, and clear accountability mechanisms. As the technology matures, responsible governance—not capability alone—will determine whether deep learning strengthens or undermines social good.
