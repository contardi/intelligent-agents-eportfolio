Welcome to my e-Portfolio for the **Intelligent Agents** module of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence programme. This repository contains practical implementations, exercises, and projects exploring agent-based computing, architectures, and multi-agent systems.

---

## üìö Module Overview

This module explores one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields within computing: Intelligent Agents. Agents are software programs that can understand their environment and act in a way that helps them achieve their desired goals. They are an intelligent and innovative tool that can be deployed in a whole range of scenarios across the private and public sector.

### Module Aims

This module aims to instill amongst students:
- An understanding of the motivations for, and appropriate use of, agent-based computing
- An understanding of the main agent models in use today and their grounding in artificial intelligence research
- The knowledge and skills required to develop, deploy and evaluate the tools and techniques of intelligent systems to solve real-world problems
- An understanding of contemporary research issues in the area of intelligent agent systems

### Module Learning Outcomes

On completion of this module, students will be able to:
1. Identify and critically analyse agent-based systems, differentiating between architectures and approaches
2. Apply and critically evaluate intelligent agent techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved
3. Deploy critically appropriate software tools and skills for the design and implementation of an agent-based system, bearing in mind applicable legal, social, ethical and professional issues
4. Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation
